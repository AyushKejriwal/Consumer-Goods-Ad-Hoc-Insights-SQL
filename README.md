## Project Overview

**AtliQ Hardwares** (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and has expanded well into other countries too.

However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director, decided to conduct a **SQL challenge** to evaluate candidates on both technical and soft skills.

This project is my submission for that challenge as part of the [Codebasics Resume Project Challenge](https://codebasics.io/challenge/codebasics-resume-project-challenge).
